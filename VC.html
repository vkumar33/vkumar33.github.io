    <center><h3>About the project</h3></center>
    <p>Sometimes you really do need to get away. Escape, part search engine and part research project from students at the MIT Senseable City Laboratory in Singapore, shows you the cheapest flights out of any given city. Just put in a location, and you get color-coded connections to everywhere around the world.</p>

    <center><h3> Purpose </h3></center>
    <p>Here we have allowed the user combined Project 1 with daily AQI Data and plotted a line chart to  see what pollutant was contributing the most to the AQI for each of those days. A stacked bar chart and table for each month of that year showing the number of days where the AQI was good / moderate / unhealthy for sensitive / unhealthy / very unhealthy / hazardous / unknown was also plotted.
