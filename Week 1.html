        <p margin-right: 20 margin-left: 20> My daily source of weather news is the Weather app for iOS. The Weather app comes pre-isntalled on all iphones, and I don't see a reason to uninstall it. It runs smoothly and displays all the information needed at first glance. The current weather is displayed at the top with a horizontal timeline of the weather for the rest of the day and a vertical timeline of the highs and lows for the rest of the week. This app gives all the information one might need on a daily basis in a meaningful way that is easy to understand.</p>
