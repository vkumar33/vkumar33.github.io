        I use my preinstalled Weather app on my Oneplus 5 to view news about the current weather conditions. The User Interface of the app is quite simple and it relays all the important information with ease. I prefer to use Celsius as my temperature scale as I am more accustomed to it. Also the source for this weather news is AccuWeather whom I find reliable.  </p>
