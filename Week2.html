        <li>In this project we use R and shiny to visualize the temperature of various rooms and figure out why the temperature changes so dramatically at times. </li>

		<li>The data consists of temperature of 7 different rooms over the past 14 years. We use different types of visualization graphs like histogram, boxplot, heatmap and line chart in order to visualize the data. </li>

		<li>We used shiny package as it makes it very easy to build interactive web apps straight from R.</li>

		<li>Reference code for this project was provided by Prof Andy Johnson. </li>
