        <h3>In this project we use R and shiny to visualize the temperature of various rooms and figure out why the temperature changes so dramatically at times. </h3>

		<h3>The data consists of temperature of 7 different rooms over the past 14 years. We use different types of visualization graphs like histogram, boxplot, heatmap and line chart in order to visualize the data. </h3>

		<h3>We used shiny package as it makes it very easy to build interactive web apps straight from R.</h3>

		<h3>Reference code for this project was provided by Prof Andy Johnson. </h3>
